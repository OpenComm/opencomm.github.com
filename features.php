			<p>In a sentence, OpenComm is an Android that strives to make communication through a phone or computer
			as intuitive as possible via an advanced user experience and sound spatialization.</p>
			<p>While face-to-face interaction is the preferred method of conversation, sometimes it is simply impossible to have everyone together in the same room.
			 The standard solution to this problem is to hold your meeting by conference call. 
			 However, a conference call using standard protocol and technology creates many problems that are not 
			 present in an actual meeting. Users are unable to discuss matters confidentially one-on-one or to 
			 split into different groups to confer before making a final decision.</p>
