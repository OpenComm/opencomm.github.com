				<h2>What is the team objective?</h2>
				<p>Our research team aims to investigate the issues with the status quo in multi-user communications and to implement front-end changes that correspond to new capabilities presented on the backend. A key backend that we’ve chosen to focus on is VoIP (Voice over IP), which has revolutionized user-to-user communication by allowing real-time voice communication. However, on the front-end, most companies have resigned themselves to simply re-implementing a phone, giving the capabilities to dial a contact, voicemail and call forwarding. While these back-end-to-front-end technologies made sense to develop in the physical world, with market instituted limitations on what users were willing to pay for; with software one can implement new solutions at little to no fixed costs to the end user. As such, we choose to focus on our development work upon currently existing backend technologies such as XML and NAT, and to build a better software front-end to them.</p>
				
				<h2>What is OpenComm?</h2>
				<p>While face-to-face interaction is the preferred method of conversation, sometimes it is simply impossible to have everyone together in the same room. The standard solution to this problem is to hold your meeting by conference call. However, a conference call using standard protocol and techology creates many problems that are not present in an actual meeting. Users are unable to discuss matters confidentially one-on-one or to split into different groups to confer before making a final decision.</p>
				
				<p>In a sentence, OpenComm is an application that strives to make communication through a phone or computer as intuitive as possible.</p>
				
				<h2>Bits on Our Mind (BOOM) 2011</h2>
				<p>"BOOM is an annual showcase of student research and creativity in digital technology and applications. It's an opportunity for Cornell undergraduate and Master's-level students to show their best work in cutting-edge technologies to the public and the Cornell community. BOOM is free and open to the public. All visitors can participate in demonstrations and vote on their favorite project, and there will be refreshments and door prizes." - <a href="www.cis.cornell.edu/boom/2011sp/About.htm">Cornell BOOM 2011</a></p>
				<p>Last year, OpenComm received the Cisco Pioneer Award and GE Imagination in IT Award.</p>
