				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>Founded by Professor Graeme Bailey and Makoto Bentz '10, MEng '11, our research team aims to investigate the issues with the status quo in multi-user communications and to implement front-end changes that correspond to new capabilities presented on the backend. A key backend that we&#39;ve chosen to focus on is VoIP (Voice over IP), which has revolutionized user-to-user communication by allowing real-time voice communication. However, on the front-end, most companies have resigned themselves to simply re-implementing a phone, giving the capabilities to dial a contact, voicemail and call forwarding. While these back-end-to-front-end technologies made sense to develop in the physical world, with market instituted limitations on what users were willing to pay for; with software one can implement new solutions at little to no fixed costs to the end user. As such, we choose to focus on our development work upon currently existing backend technologies such as XML and NAT, and to build a better software front-end to them.</p>

				<h3>Bits on Our Mind (BOOM) 2011</h3>
				<p><span class="quote">&quot;BOOM is an annual showcase of student research and creativity in digital technology and applications. It&#39;s an opportunity for Cornell undergraduate and Master&#39;s-level students to show their best work in cutting-edge technologies to the public and the Cornell community. BOOM is free and open to the public. All visitors can participate in demonstrations and vote on their favorite project, and there will be refreshments and door prizes.&quot;</span> - <a href="http://www.cis.cornell.edu/boom/2011sp/About.htm">Cornell BOOM 2011</a></p>
