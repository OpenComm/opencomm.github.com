                <div class="span6"><h3>Side Chats</h3></div></div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="span6"><p>Once you add users into a conference, there may be situations where you want to hear some people better than others. With sound spacialization, you can manipulate how you hear each participant by moving their icons around the conference. You can experience the conference call as if you were in your meeting room. </p></div>
                <div class="span6"><p> Side chats are separate conversations with people in the conference, where you can plan ahead for the conference or talk about private or sensitive subjects. You can add side chats by clicking on the plus icon on the bottom of the screen. Adding people in the side chat is done the same way as with conferences, where the list of contacts is changed to the list of people in the conference. All of the side chats you are in are listed next to the plus sign. You can easily go in by simply selecting the side chat and then go out by selecting another side chat or the main conference icon.  </p></div>

            <div class="row">
            	<div class="span6"><p>When you select the sound icon at the top right of the screen, you will be able to dynamically change the volume for the conference and each side chat within it. The volume bars for each side chat align with its icon on the bottom, so you will be able to slide through the side chats.You can specifically make chats sound louder or softer. </p></div>
                <div class="span6"><p>Moderators can add or remove people from a conference or a side chat. Initially the creator of any conference or side chat is designated as the moderator. If anyone who is not a moderator wants to add someone to the conference or side chat, they will have to send a request to the moderator first. When moderators wants to leave a conference or chat, they will choose another person to pass their moderator rights to. </p></div>

All you need to do is select "Start Conference" from the main menu and then add users into the conference. To do this, you can either press on the screen or select the menu button to display the add users option. You will be able to add multiple users from your list of contacts.</p></div>

        	<div class="span12"><p> Founded by Professor Graeme Bailey and Makoto Bentz '10, M.Eng. '11, our research team aims to add exciting functions to the status quo in multi-user communications and to implement front-end changes to reflect these changes.</p><p>We've focused on VoIP (Voice over IP), which has revolutionized user-to-user communications by allowing real-time voice communication. On the front-end, most companies have resigned themselves to simply re-implementing a phone, giving the capabilities dial a contact, voicemail, and call forwarding. While these technologies made sense to develop in the physical world, with software one can implement new solutions at little to no fixed costs to users.</p><p>We chose to focus our development work upon currently existing backend technologies such as XML and NAT and build a better software front end with them.</p></div>
