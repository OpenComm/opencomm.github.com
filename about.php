			<p>Founded by Professor Grmae Bailey and Makoto Bentz '10, M.Eng. '11, 
			our research team aims to investigate the issues with the status quo in
			multi-user communications and to implement front-end changes that correspond to new
			capabilities presented on the backend. A key backend that we've chosen to focus on
			is VoIP (Voice over IP), which has revolutionized user-to-user communications
			 by allowing real-time voice communication. However, on the front-end, most companies have
			 resigned themselves to simply re-implementing a phone, giving the capabilities
			 to dial a contact, voicemail, and call forwarding. While these
			  back-end-to-front-end technologies made sense to develop in the physical world, with
			  market instituted limitations on what users were willing to pay for;
			  with software one can implement new solution at little to no fixed costs to the end user.
			  As such, we chose to focus on our development work upon currently existing backend technologies
			  such as XML and NAT, and to build a better software front end to them.</p>
